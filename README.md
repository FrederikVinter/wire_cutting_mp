# Utilizing the Redundancy for Cartesian Space Constrained Motion Planning in Robotic Wire Cutting Applications 
This repository contains the source code for a BSc project concerning motion planning for a wire cutting application exploring how Cartesian redundacies of the tool can be utilized in order to find optimal robot paths.
The code is developed in the motion planning framework `Tesseract` (https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/tesseract).
