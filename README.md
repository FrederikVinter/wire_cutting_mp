# Utilizing the Redundancy for Cartesian Space Constrained Motion Planning in Robotic Wire Cutting Applications 
This repository contains the source code for a BSc project concerning motion planning for a wire cutting application.
The code runs in the motion planning framework `Tesseract` (https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/tesseract).

## Demonstration
A selection of .gifs showcasing wire cutting in both a simulated and a physical environment are located in `/demos`
